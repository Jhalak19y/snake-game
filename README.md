# snake-game
A classic Snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. This game features a basic yet engaging implementation of the Snake game mechanics.

Features:

1. Classic Gameplay: Navigate the snake using arrow keys to collect food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries.
2. Start Screen: A user-friendly start screen that prompts the player to press any key to begin the game.
3. Real-time Movement: Smooth and responsive controls for moving the snake in all four directions: up, down, left, and right.
4. Dynamic Score Display: Real-time display of the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes food.
5. Game Over Screen: A game over screen that shows the final score when the game ends, with a brief pause before the game exits.
6. Boundary Wrapping: The snake wraps around the screen edges, reappearing on the opposite side if it goes off-screen.
7. Food Generation: Randomized food placement on the grid, adding variety to the gameplay experience.
8. Collision Detection: Accurate collision detection for both the snake's self-collision and boundary collisions.

How to Play:

1. Start the Game: Press any key on the start screen to begin playing.
2. Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys to direct the snake's movement.
3. Eat the Food: The snake will grow in length each time it eats food.
4. Avoid Collisions: Do not let the snake collide with itself or the screen boundaries.
5. Check Your Score: Your score increases as you eat more food.
6. Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries. The final score will be displayed before the game closes.
